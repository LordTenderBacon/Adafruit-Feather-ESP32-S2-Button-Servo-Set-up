# Adafruit-Feather-ESP32-S2-Button-Servo-Set-up
This project uses an ESP32-S2 to control a servo motor with a button. The servo toggles between open (green NeoPixel) and closed (red NeoPixel) states upon button presses. Includes debouncing for reliable operation.  Components: ESP32-S2, Servo Motor, NeoPixel LED.  Wiring: Servo on GPIO 3, NeoPixel on GPIO 33, Button on GPIO A4.
